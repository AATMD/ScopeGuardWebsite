    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 11, 2026</p>

    <p>Mathys Thevenot ("we", "us", or "our") operates the ScopeGuard mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our App.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h3>
    <p>ScopeGuard stores all your project data (project names, scope changes, notes, hours, and settings) locally on your device using AsyncStorage. This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any server. We do not have access to this data.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Data Collected by Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>Our App integrates third-party services that may collect certain data:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Service</th>
          <th>Data Collected</th>
          <th>Purpose</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Google AdMob</strong></td>
          <td>Device advertising identifier (IDFA), IP address (coarse location), ad interaction data, crash logs, performance diagnostics</td>
          <td>Displaying advertisements</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>RevenueCat</strong></td>
          <td>Anonymous app user ID, purchase history, device identifiers for entitlement verification</td>
          <td>Managing in-app purchases and subscriptions</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>2. How We Use Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>App functionality:</strong> Your locally stored project data is used solely to provide the app's core features (tracking projects and scope changes).</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> Google AdMob uses collected data to serve ads within the free version of the App. Personalized ads are only shown with your consent.</li>
      <li><strong>Purchase management:</strong> RevenueCat processes purchase data to verify your subscription status and unlock Pro features.</li>
      <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> Crash logs and performance data help us improve app stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), we rely on the following legal bases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contract performance:</strong> Processing necessary to provide the App's features and manage your purchases.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Personalized advertising via Google AdMob. You can grant or withdraw consent at any time.</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interest:</strong> Diagnostics and app stability improvements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data. Data may be shared with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google (AdMob):</strong> For advertising purposes, subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> For purchase management, subject to <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RevenueCat's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Apple:</strong> For App Store purchases and subscriptions, subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local data:</strong> Stored on your device until you delete the App or clear its data. We never access this data.</li>
      <li><strong>AdMob data:</strong> Retained by Google according to their data retention policies.</li>
      <li><strong>Purchase data:</strong> Retained by RevenueCat and Apple for the duration required to manage your subscription and comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the following rights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request information about data collected about you.</li>
      <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Delete your local data by uninstalling the App. For data held by third parties (Google, RevenueCat), contact them directly or reach out to us for assistance.</li>
      <li><strong>Withdraw consent:</strong> You can withdraw advertising consent at any time through the App's settings or your device's privacy settings (Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Tracking).</li>
      <li><strong>Data portability:</strong> Request a copy of your data in a portable format.</li>
      <li><strong>Object:</strong> Object to data processing for advertising purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. App Tracking Transparency</h2>
    <p>On iOS 14.5 and later, ScopeGuard will request your permission before allowing third-party services to track your activity across other apps and websites. You can change this permission at any time in your device settings under Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking.</p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>ScopeGuard is not directed at children under 13 (or under 16 in the EEA). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such data, please contact us so we can take steps to delete it.</p>

    <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Your project data is stored locally on your device and protected by your device's built-in security features (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID). We do not operate servers that store your personal data.</p>

    <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Third-party services (Google AdMob, RevenueCat) may transfer data to countries outside the EEA. These transfers are protected by appropriate safeguards, including Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
